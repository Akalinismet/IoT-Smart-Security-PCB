# IoT Smart Security & Motion Detector PCB

This repository contains the Altium Designer files for a custom-designed IoT security node. The board is designed to monitor motion using a PIR sensor and communicate alerts via Wi-Fi, powered directly from AC mains.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project was developed to master **Altium Designer** workflows, specifically focusing on mixed-signal integration (High Voltage AC + Low Voltage Logic). It combines an STM32 microcontroller for real-time sensor management and an ESP32 for wireless connectivity.

### Key Features
* **Dual-Core Architecture:** STM32F103 (Main Logic) + ESP32 (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth).
* **Onboard Power Supply:** Integrates an AC-DC converter (Bridge + Transformer) to step down 220V to 12V, followed by DC-DC buck converters for 5V and 3.3V logic levels.
* **Modular Sensing:** Features a separate break-out board for the PIR sensor and temperature monitoring to allow flexible placement.
* **Actuator Control:** Includes onboard relays for triggering external alarms or lights.

## ⚠️ High Voltage Warning

**DANGER:** This circuit is designed to handle **110V/220V AC Mains voltage**.
* The high-voltage section is present on the PCB.
* Proper isolation gaps and creepage distances were considered for educational practice but should be verified against standards before actual use.
* **Do not touch** the board while powered.
